Content pending: This section will describe ROS 2 hardware interfaces, controllers, and real-time execution patterns.  

Planned outline:  

1. Overview of control architecture (nodes, executors, hardware layers)  
2. ros2_control framework basics (hardware_interface, controller_manager)  
3. Writing a custom hardware interface  
4. Loading and configuring controllers  
5. Real-time safe communication patterns  
6. Diagnostics and introspection tools  
7. Example: integrating a differential drive robot
