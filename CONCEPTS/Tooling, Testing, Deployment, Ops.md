# ROS 2 Tooling, Testing, Deployment, and Ops
 
Content forthcoming.

Planned coverage:
- Tooling: colcon, ros2 CLI, launch system, formatting, linting, static/static+dynamic analysis
- Testing: ament test, GTest, pytest, ROS integration/system tests, QoS test patterns, CI workflows
- Deployment: packaging, cross-compilation, containers (Docker), reproducible builds, artifacts
- Operations: parameters, lifecycle nodes, logging, monitoring, tracing, performance profiling, security (SROS2)

Roadmap (next updates):
1. Minimal colcon workspace example
2. Test matrix and CI configuration sample
3. Container build + runtime optimization notes
4. Observability (ros2 doctor, tracing) and security quickstart

Contributions welcome.
