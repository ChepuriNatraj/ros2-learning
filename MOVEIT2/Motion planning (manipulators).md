# Motion Planning (Manipulators)

This document will outline how to perform motion planning for robotic manipulators in ROS 2 using MoveIt 2.
  
## Planned Sections

1. Overview of motion planning concepts
2. Environment setup (ROS 2 + MoveIt 2)
3. Creating a MoveIt config package
4. Loading a robot model (URDF / SRDF)
5. Planning pipeline (OMPL, constraints, planners)
6. Executing a plan (simulation vs real hardware)
7. Collision checking and planning scene
8. Cartesian vs joint-space planning
9. Grasp planning (future)
10. Troubleshooting and debugging tools
