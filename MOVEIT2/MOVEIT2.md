#   What is MoveIt2?

MoveIt2 is the ROS2-compatible version of MoveIt. MoveIt is a ROS framework that allows you to perform motion planning with a specific robot. What does this mean? It means that it enables you to plan a movement (motion) from point A to point B without colliding with anything.

MoveIt2 provides a friendly and easy-to-use GUI, which helps you interact with the robot to perform motion planning (as you already tested in the introduction unit). However, before using MoveIt2, you need to build a MoveIt2 package. This package will contain all the configuration and launch files required for controlling your robot with MoveIt2.

The **MoveIt Setup Assistant** is typically used to generate and configure this package easily. The Setup Assistant helps you in the process of configuring a MoveIt2 package for your specific robot (which would be a pretty complex task without this assistant).
